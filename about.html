                <div class="column">
                    <p>Stanford University was founded in 1885 by California senator Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane, in memory of their son, Leland Stanford Jr., who died of typhoid fever at age 15. The Stanfords decided to build a university of "absolute non-sectarianism and complete equality of opportunity regardless of gender, on their farm in California's Santa Clara Valley.</p>
                    <p>The university opened its doors in 1891, and from the outset was coeducational and non-denominational. The institution's first students enrolled in 1891, and the first bachelor's degrees were conferred in 1892.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <p>In the early 20th century, Stanford struggled with financial challenges but persevered. The 1940s saw a dramatic increase in federal funding for scientific research, establishing Stanford as a leading research institution. The post-war period marked significant expansion, particularly in the sciences and engineering fields.</p>
                    <p>Today, Stanford is one of the world's leading research and teaching institutions, committed to finding solutions to challenges and to preparing students for leadership in today's complex world.</p>
